# DOA stepper experiments

__Time__: Thursday 14.10.2021, afternoon

__Recorded by__: Frederike Duembgen

__Place__: INR018

## Notes 

Note that these were taken on, after the ones on Tuesday did not work.

Video from 11:24

- 1:28: appendix new, no motors and turning. 
- 2:20: with motors, not turning correctly... 
- 9:00: new3 with motors, still not working
- 10:30: new4 with motors, hardfault on stepper, but otherwise ok.

Video starting from 10:56

- linear -300, with motors
starting at 2:39:
- turning 360, without motors
with motors does not work for some reason.
